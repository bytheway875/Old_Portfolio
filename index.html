               <h3> About Me </h3>
                <p> Hi! I'm Shannon, a graduate of the first class of MakerSquare web development bootcamp. In ten short weeks, I've learned languages and frameworks including Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Java, JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. But more importantly, I've learned how to think like a programmer: quickly, critically, and creatively.
                </p>

                <!-- <p> I've got diverse experience in marketing, sales, and operations at companies ranging from three to 400 employees, but what every position has in common is my passion for the company and my work.
                </p> -->

                <p> I'm excited (and honestly a little shocked) to have found my passion in web development and I can't wait to find job at which I can continue to learn and sharpen my skills. I'm looking for a full-time web developer position at a collaborative and innovative company with a kick butt culture.
                </p>

                    An exercise in creating a :has_many, :through ActiveRecord relationships. The home index shows all books added by all users (and populates information from the Goodreads API using the book's ISBN number). Each user page shows all books on that user's digital bookshelf. When a user destroys an entry from their own bookshelf, it still persists in the books database and on other users' bookshelves.

                    My first native Ruby application that I ported to Rails as my three-week checkpoint project at MakerSquare. Enter a twitter handle to generate a random tweet from the user's timeline. After eliminating stop words, two keywords are chosen to generate a random GIF using the Giphy API. Sometimes the results make no sense, but every once in a while the GIF/Tweet combo is pretty hilarious.

                    I created this portfolio page as an exercise in HTML5 and CSS3. It was our first project in MakerSquare and my first web design project ever (unless you count my tricked out 9th grade AIM profile). I wanted the design to reflect my Texan roots. When I have some time, I'd like to redesign the page to reflect my budding interest in Flat UI and port the project to Rails to integrate an Octopress blog.
